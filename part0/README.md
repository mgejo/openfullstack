#Part 0 excercises
0.4 and 0.6 were done first without testing the pages in the browser, and based only in the information in the course. That's why they have a deprecated URL, while 0.5 has the currently valid URL.
The JSON used in 0.4 was an exact copy from the one present in the deprecated URL.
The JSON used in 0.5 is an exact copy from the one present in the currently valid URL at the time of doing this excercise.
